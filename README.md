<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hello friend, my name is chickenshifu (Â∏´ÂÇÖ) and I am a very ambitious hobby software developer who very much enjoys solving my own and friends everyday struggles with the help of software.</p>
<p>As in 2021, our world is intensively connected to the internet, most of my projects are focussing on web automation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>üî≠ currently working on <a href='https://github.com/chickenshifu/WikifolioPy'>WikifolioPy</a> (a handy tool for automated trading on wikifolio.com) + some CLI tools</li>
  <li>üå± continuously improving my skills in: Python and Golang</li>
  <li>‚å®Ô∏è like to dabble with both new (e.g. Rust) and old programming languages (e.g. COBOL)</li>
  <li>üí¨ ask me about anything! :)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
<p>One of the greatest things when developing software is that one never learns out. Thus, remaining flexible is crucial and being a quick learner has helped and still helps me enormously adapting to new cool languages, tools and technologies.</p>
