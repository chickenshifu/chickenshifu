<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hello friend, my name is chickenshifu (å¸«å‚…) and I am a very ambitious hobby software developer who very much enjoys solving my everyday problems with the help of software.</p>

<ul>
<li>ðŸ”­ currently working on **yabt** (=*yet another backtester*) + some CLI tools</li>
<li>ðŸŒ± continuously improving my skills in: Python, golang, COBOL as well as quantitative finance and statistics</li>
<li>ðŸ’¬ ask me about anything! :)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
<p>One of the greatest things when developing software is that one never learns out. Thus, remaining flexible is crucial and being a quick learner has helped and still helps me enormously adapting to new cool languages, tools and technologies.</p>
